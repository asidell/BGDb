"105593","7","Cheating is forbidden? Not in this naughty game of cards - in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.

In Mogel Motte you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug - which stays on the table throughout the game - and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.

On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.

There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug - and only him! - can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.

Cheating is a necessity as the 'Cheating Moth' cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)

The action cards work as follows:


    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.
    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it. Only the fastest player gets to leave her card in place.
    Mosquito: After a mosquito is played, everyone but the active player must slap the pile of cards. Whoever is slowest receives a card from the hand of all other players.
    Spider: After playing this, give a non-Cheating Moth card from your hand to another player.


When one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All other players score 10 points for each Cheating Moth in hand, 5 points for each action card, and 1 point for each number card. After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.

"1080","10","extrapolated from user review:

The object is to be the first player to evolve along the 6 stages of evolution into man. You start as a lungfish. Over the course of a turn, you roll a die to determine if you get to mutate, and then move to run away from predators.

Mutation is easier if you are in a warm climate. And if you are lucky enough to get a mutation card, you will either evolve, or pick up some mutation which can affect your movement or mutation abilities.

At the end of your turn, you flip up a card which lets you move and introduce certain type of new predators, evolve predators, and move continents.

Yes, the continents drift around the board, offering you chances to break a land bridge to strand your opponents on a plate along with a few hungry dinosaurs. Or drift yourself southward to bask and mutate in the sun.

The only other twist is that predators can only eat during certain player evolutionary stages. So trying not to mutate can be a very good idea at certain stages of the game. Being eaten costs you an evolutionary stage-so picking on the leader can help keep the game even.

"1294","8","For versions of Clue that feature the new character Dr. Orchid, please use this Clue page.

The classic detective game!  In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file.  A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.

Note: There are some early versions of Clue which are labeled as 2-6 players.

Clue/do is a murder mystery game. The aim is to find out who committed the murder, which weapon they used, and where in the mansion they did it. How do you solve the case? By careful questioning of your fellow players you can deduce which information is concealed in the crime envelope. The trick is to be clever with your questioning... Everyone develops their own system! 
 This version of the game plays faster than older versions of Clue, with the help of bigger spaces on the board, special Red Cards, and a new layout of the mansion so you can walk between rooms. The bedroom has an ensuite, and you can wander from the kitchen straight into the dining room.

All new artwork brings this classic murder mystery to life, with a high level of detail.

It also comes with cool red dice!

Note: In this version of Clue, when playing with the 2-player/Team rules: before you deal the black Clue cards to the players, you take the top four black CLUE cards from the deck and place them face down in a row at the side of the board. When the other player/team cannot answer your question, you get to secretly look at one of the four cards at the side of the board.

You also don't use the Red Bonus cards in a 2-player/Team game.

"1410","4","This is the game with the Pop-O-Matic dice roller.  It's a simplified Pachisi variant in which only one die is rolled per turn.

The game is abstract, each player has set of pawns of his color. Each turn player rolls a die using the Pop-O-Matic and selects one of his pawns to move. Pawns can enter the track from Home base only on a roll of six. Each pawn needs to travel around the board and finish on the Finish lane. If pawn of another player is bumped, the bumped pawn is returned to home. The goal is to be the first one to get all the pawns to the Finish lane.

For advanced players, we suggest that when a piece gets bumped, it should only be bumped back to its START space, rather than to its HOME.  Only when bumped from their START space are pieces sent HOME.

Travel Trouble uses the same mechanisms, but is on a smaller board with fewer spaces, so it plays more quickly.

"148949","10","There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.

In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...

In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:


    Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good.
    Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit.
    Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect.
    Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies.
    Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else.


When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who's reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.

"155703","12","In Evolution, players adapt their species in a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk.  Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.

Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules.  The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.  Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.  Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.  Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.  And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.  So gather your friends and see who can best adapt to the changing world around them.

'The theme of evolution is not just tacked on: it drives play.' - Nature (the world's most prestigious scientific journal)  
Evolution was covered in the journal Nature.  The article was written by Stuart West, a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Oxford who has used Evolution in his undergraduate class.

__With a grinding of gears and some uneasy rumbling, Aperture Laboratories has resumed testing! Your team of test subjects has entered the Lab and is ready to perform all sorts of important, dignified, and dangerous testing procedures...all in the pursuit of cake! It's a fun and funny fast-paced fight to the finish - and by finish, we mean your team probably died.
__The Lab is an ever-changing conveyor belt of death and dismemberment. But SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS must be at the forefront of the mind of every good test subject. In Portal: The Uncooperative Cake Acquisition Game, a game of constantly shifting area control and cardplay by the creators of the Portal and Portal 2 video games, players move and Portal their test subjects to various chambers in the lab. At the end of each player's turn, one of the chambers on the end of the lab gives way, plunging all test subjects on it into oblivion. But should your test subjects have numbered greater than all others in the falling chamber, they earn you some wonderful parting gifts, which can include cake.
__Yet these moist slices of industrial-grade cake must be stored in the lab where they are at risk of falling into said oblivion. Not to mention that your jealous opponents can pick up your cake and move it closer to that precipice. He who has acquired the most cake when a team has lost its last test subject wins. Do you risk gathering cake early for a quick win? Or do you bide your time and wait until you can protect it better? Win the game and prove the cake was no lie.

"15987","14","The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties. Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It's a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars.


        Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.


        Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror.  Will they Prevail? 

_Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many portals open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world. Defeat the Ancient One in combat!

"161936","13","Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.
__During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.
__After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.
__Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.
__During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.
__Part of the Pandemic series

After one of those words has been read aloud, players try to come up with definitions that at least sound plausible, because points are later awarded for every opposing player who guessed that your definition was the correct one.
__Versions of the game as a parlor game go back at least as far as 1970, although Balderdash itself was not published until 1984.

"166384","13","Spyfall is a party game unlike any other, one in which you get to be a spy and try to understand what's going on around you. It's really simple!
__Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location - a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station - except that one player receives a card that says 'Spy' instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions - 'Why are you dressed so strangely?' or 'When was the last time we got a payday?' or anything else you can come up with - trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!
__At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy. If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.  However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points.
__After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!

Can you and your fellow investigators manage to find and seal every portal in time? Hurry before you lose yourself to insanity and the evil that lurks beneath your feet...
__Part of the Pandemic series.

"194232","15","Rick and Morty: Total Rickall Card Game is based on the Rick and Morty episode of the same name. If you haven't seen it, don't worry. You can still play this wild and wacky game and have plenty of fun - but you really should see it at some point. Seriously. Don't be a Jerry.
__Rick has locked the family inside their house. Why? Because the family has grown. Parasites masquerading as family and close friends have infiltrated and have inserted pleasant memories into everyone's minds to make them think they're real - and more keep coming! You must figure out which of these new, zany characters are real and which ones are parasites that need to be exterminated.  Think you've got what it takes to save the world?
__The game features a basic fully cooperative mode and an advanced mode, where there are two teams.___In the advanced mode, players will be dealt a hidden role as either Real or a Parasite. The Parasite players must try to keep at least one parasite alive in the end (keeping yourself alive is the easiest way to do this). The Real players must root out the Parasites to win.___Now you can shoot the other players! But if you accidentally shoot a Real player, there are consequences...___There is no player elimination, however. A player's secret identity might change, though.

"205867","12","Give as good as you get in Bohnanza: The Duel!
__What was that thing about the gift horse? In this two-player variant of Bohnanza, both bean farmers give each other gifts of beans they can't use themselves - to make life harder for their opponent, if possible. Trying to fulfill their secret 'bo(h)nus' requirements, they both need to keep a vigilant eye on the other player's bean fields.
__In more detail, both duelists have bean field mats in front of themselves on which to plant their beans. Between them is a row of eight gift cards. Each player holds five hand cards and three 'bo(h)nus cards' with secret objectives. In this game, you have the option of planting more than one type of bean in the same field, but when you plant a different bean than the one you've planted previously, this new bean type must be the next highest number. When harvesting your beans, the beanometer of the card you've most recently planted is what counts.
__At the start of each turn, the active player plants two beans from their hand, then reveals bean cards from the deck as usual. Instead of trading, however, they offer their opponent one bean as a gift by pushing this bean type's gift card in their direction. The other player can accept the gift or decline it, but if they don't take it, they have to offer a gift in return. You are allowed to bluff, but it may cost you if your bluff is called! Important: Only the first player to accept a gift actually receives the bean card in question. After this exchange, plant all beans you have received and turned over, then draw new cards. 'Bo(h)nus' cards can be fulfilled at any time when the required combination of beans printed on the card can be found in any bean field. Fulfilling an objective earns you bean dollars and the brand new bean cents. When the draw pile is used up, the player with the most bean dollars wins.
__In 2020, AMIGO released Bohnanza: The Duel - Deluxe, which replaces the gift cards with a game board and gift tokens. This edition also contains newly designed bean fields and bonus cards.

"206715","13","Ultimate Werewolf is an interactive game of deduction for two teams: villagers and werewolves. The villagers don't know who the werewolves are, and the werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the villagers one at a time. A moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game. The game takes place over a series of days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns if one player is a werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the villagers or all the werewolves are eliminated.

Ultimate Werewolf Legacy uses gameplay similar to Ultimate Werewolf, but you no longer have single standalone games as players and the village itself have attributes that are retained between games, with events that take place in the first games having effects that ripple through remaining games. Make a bad decision early on, and it can haunt the village for years to come! Players can earn titles, which provides them with special abilities in future games, regardless of their role. Players are each given a public family card in addition to their secret role card, and they team up with the other members of their family to work together...unless one or more of their family members is secretly working against them.

As for the village, there are multiple paths that the game may take, and as a result the experience you have playing through the entire game will differ from someone else who is playing with another set of people. This also allows players to play through the campaign multiple times, with a different set of roles, rules, and environments each time.

At the center of Ultimate Werewolf Legacy is an oversized, 80+ page diary, that walks the game moderator through every session. The diary has been designed so that players with no previous Werewolf playing experience can both play and moderate. The diary is structured into five distinct chapters with three game sessions in each chapter, as well as an introductory preface game session. Players can jump in and out for individual sessions, but ideally they'll play all the sessions in a chapter. Each chapter can be played in a single evening. At the end of the sixteen-game session campaign, the diary will be a record of exactly what happened in your village, and who was ultimately responsible for what it became over time.

Replay packs that contain a new diary and an additional set of family cards will be sold separately, allowing players to play through the entire campaign again.

     Driver Action gives you access to the market to acquire ingredients to store in your fridge.
     Cashier Action gives you access to an assortment of customer orders ready to be prepared and served up.
     Prep Cook Action allows you to move ingredients in your fridge to the customer orders.
     Executive Chef Action allows you to play ingredients directly from your hand to a customer order.

As owners of the food truck, you have a special wild card that you can take into your hand, allowing you to act in any capacity when the need arises.

At the start of the game, each food truck has a small fridge, a narrow plating area, and limited room for staff. Each completed order gives you a popularity token worth victory points and it allows you to expand one of the areas of your truck, or even expand the card limit in your hand.

At certain points in the game, judges will review the orders you've completed and allow you to move certain cards into your awards area, giving your bonus VP for each set of awards you complete.

When a certain number of popularity tokens have been claimed, the game ends and the food truck with the most victory points is declared the Food Truck Champion!

Players must lay a path of  eras (cards) in chronological order, outwards from their edge of the board. The objective is to be first to  advance your playing piece onto the end era of your own path. Cards are drawn from a main pack which contains eras  cards . Play actions are determined by what symbol shows when the die is thrown. The three symbols are era ( reveal an era) , thunderbolt ( take a thunderbolt card) and eruption ( move or or erupt volcanoes on an opponents path). Thunderbolt cards are not laid but trigger various natural calamity and more benign events. Each era card is an aerial view associated with a particular evolutionary period. Each era card has various sites to be negotiated including rocks,waterholes, swamps, volcanoes, rising seas and ravines. Different sites have different levels of risk (hazardous areas). Certain thunderbolts can penalize players whose paths have cards that contain hazardous areas. Players interact by contesting some or each era card by a bidding using tokens.  A neat (new) rule limit player's from bidding excessively because tokens are lost by the winning bidder depending on the bid difference between his and the next highest bid.  A player who wins an era card may be include it in any path. He may for example, include a card with a risky site  in an opponent's path. Each player now has his own   cone (volcano) which  can be moved to  create an obstacle for an opponent's playing piece and can cause an eruption on an opponent path. An eruption   can be used to   force an opponents playing piece back .  The first player who survives his turn with his path complete ( 6 era cards ), holding at least one token  and with his  piece on his end ( sixth) era card  wins the game.

"2425","8","Battleship was originally a pencil-and-paper public domain game known by different names, but Milton Bradley made it into the well known board game in 1967.  The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.

Each player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by 'Hit!' or 'Miss!'.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.

The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots. Destroyer: 3 Shots, Etc.).

In 2008, Hasbro 'reinvented' the game into Battleship (Revised).

Some history of the published versions of the game:
1931: Starex Novelty Co. of NY publishes Salvo.
1933: The Strathmore Co. publishes Combat, The Battleship Game.
1943: Milton Bradley publishes the pad-and-pencil game Broadsides, The Game of Naval Strategy.
1943: Also published in 1943 Sink it by the L R Gebert Co. for distribution by G. Krueger Brewing Co.
1940's: Maurice L. Freedman Co. of RI publishes Warfare Naval Combat.
1961: Ideal publishes Salvo.

Other titles over the years have included Swiss Navy, Sunk (Parker Bros.), Convoy (Transogram), Wings (Strategy Games Co. of California), and Naval Battle (3M Paper and Pencil Version) .

"2452","6","A tower building game.

Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.

Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.

The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.

The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name 'Hoppla - eins zuviel!'

According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. 'Jenga' is Swahili for 'build'.

"246701","7","DOS is the follow up to the classic card game UNO.  Like UNO, the object of DOS is to be the first player each round to get rid of all your cards and earn points for the cards left in your opponents' hands.

On your turn you can play cards from your hand by matching their numbers to any of the face up cards in the center row.  You can play one match for each card in the center row.  You can also combine two cards from your hand that add up to the number you wish to match.  If the card(s) you played match both number and color, you earn the right to place extra cards from your hand in the center row and even force other players to draw cards.  Don't forget to yell 'Dos!' whenever you have two cards in your hand or you could end up drawing more cards!

The round ends when one player gets rid of all his cards. That player earns points based on the values of the cards left in the other players' hands. Continue playing in rounds until someone reaches 200 points. That player is the winner.

Place your servant dice on treasure cards, choosing any value on each die. Choosing a higher value can ward off your opponents, but it also increases the odds that your servant will become exhausted. After everyone has placed their servant dice, everyone rolls. If you roll less than your chosen value, you lose the die.

Sets of treasure can be pawned off to collectors that offer bonus coins and special abilities. The player with the most valuable collection wins!

"257283","14","It's the year 3030, and technology offers humankind unimaginable entertainment. What used to be virtual reality is now reality, and sports that once occupied your flat-screen now occupy the world stage. The largest of them embodies the evolution and integration of athleticism and machinery. Once every five years, hundreds of millions of viewers tune in to witness the spectacle that is M.E.C.H.s: Mechanized Entertainment Combat Heroes.

Tiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of.

In Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. They compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. These actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill.

Your programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset.

Combat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own.

Find heroes that fit your personality, or mix it up.  Watch for expansion packs, which add scores more heroes, minions, and enemy bosses to the mix.

The intent of the game is to have the most assets at the end of the game, assets are earned primarily by working and earning tokens with dollars amount on them.  Additionally the first person to complete the course gets additional money tokens.

There is a very linear board that you move along by spinning a wheel or landing on spaces that tell you to move to a specific space or forward or back.  There are a handful of intersections where you can choose to go one direction or another but they ultimately have similar spaces and meet back up quickly.  There are a handful of choices regarding insurance and investments but for the most part it is a game of luck.

Note -- this entry covers many versions of the game with different rule sets.  In general, the newer the printing the gentler the rules.

__The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the 'normal' spread of the infections.
__Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five-but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!

"308416","0","From designer Edmund McMillen, Tapeworm is a game in which players compete to build tapeworms and empty their hands of tiles, in the form of cards.

The game begins with the laying down of the starting tile, which depicts the kinds of tapeworms stitched together. The first turn is either determined by who resembles a worm the most or at random. A player's turn includes the drawing and laying down of matching tiles, which continues until a matching head segment is laid down, thereby completing the tapeworm. Whichever player ends up with an empty hand wins the game.

There are special mechanics to propel a player forward, as well as cards intended to hinder the efforts of their opponents. These cards include: Cut, to sever a worm segment at play; Peek, to draw a card and replace it with another card from a hand; Hatch, to force an opponent to draw from the deck; Swap, to look at an opponent's hand and decide if cards should be traded; Dig, to draw a card from the deck and discard one from a hand. If a player creates a fully-connected ring of cards, it is identified as a Ringworm, resulting in the discarding of two cards from a hand.

McMillen developed the prototype for Tapeworm alongside The Binding of Isaac in 2011, after releasing Super Meat Boy. For years, McMillen would play the game privately with family and friends, without pursuing it professionally. In 2018, Studio71, the publisher of The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls, was visiting McMillen to document the completion of the game, they were shown Tapeworm. Studio71 tested the game and began the process leading up to publishing it.

"317313","12","Crypt Hunters is a fast-paced game of exploration and adventure for two players, set in the world of Warhammer Age of Sigmar. Orris Suresight and his Stormcast Eternals must find an ancient relic hidden amidst the twisting catacombs of the Ten Thousand Tombs, or the city of Glymmsforge will fall to the undead. Will you play the stalwart Stormcast Eternals, clad in gleaming golden armour and armed with powerful weapons, or the vengeful spirits of the Chainrasps intend on dooming Glymmsforge forever?

In each game the Chainrasp player creates the labyrinth, while the Stormcast Eternals players searches its twisting passages for the Hyshian Luminator, the ancient relic that will save Glymmsforge. The board is made up of hexagon tiles, and as the Stormcast Eternals player searches further, the labyrinth will reveal infernal traps and can divide into sections leading some Stormcast Eternals to become lost in the dungeon depths.

You'll resolve your actions using a set of special dice, and mark status effects with tokens. Each faction also utilizes a deck of cards with powerful effects. Banish your enemies with the holy energy of Sigmar, or inflict them with supernatural terror. Every roll of the dice could swing the outcome in your favour, or doom you to ignoble defeat. To win, the Stormcast Eternal player must first find the Winch tile, and then activate the Hyshian Luminator, banishing the undead. The Chainrasp player wins if all the Stormcast Eternals are slain. Play a single game, or combine your games in a campaign, and add new challenges with a unique system of optional Burdens.

At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game.

The card mix focuses on Holy Grail with other references added from Flying Circus and other Python material. For example, one win condition card might require you have to have the Knights who Say Ni and a Shrubbery card face up in front of you.

"39283","0","Crypt:  Monster and magic in a dungeon you create!

In Crypt, players take on the role of evil wizards who control competing monster forces, which move about in a dungeon that constantly grows.  Each turn, a player may take one of three actions:  lay a tile which expands the dungeon, move a monster in his force, or cast a magic spell.  The objective is to move your monsters into enemy Crypts.

Monsters begin the game in their home Crypt.  Each has a strength and movement rating.  Strong monsters are slow, weak ones fast.  Which will you play early and which will you save for later?  Which will you use to defend, and which will seek entry into enemy Crypts?

Dungeon tiles are used to build the dungeon.  Lay them carefully to block monsters from entering your Crypt, and make entryways into enemy Crypts.

Spell tiles keep things interesting.  Poisons lower abilities; Potions raise them.  A Reaper could mean instant death, while a Seraph returns you safely to your Crypt.  Traps stop movement, while a Ghost lets you walk through walls.  Or use Transporters to pop up in unexpected places.  Suffering under an enemy spell? Remove it with a Zapper.

Crypt is an easily-learned, quick-playing tile-laying game suitable for 2-4 players Ages 8 and up.  It is available as a self-published print-and-play game.

Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!
__The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.
__Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players' identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.
__Rule Correction:
__For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: 'Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.' and '...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)' - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.

"50381","17","'A party game for horrible people.'

Play begins with a judge, known as the 'Card Czar', choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players.  Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an 'Awesome Point', and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.

This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like 'Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor'.

In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are 'Pick 2' or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.
